# project-overseas
Project Overseas was our second project right after Claculator that we did as a team. <br/>
It uses all that we have learned till now, was our first stop to avoid using frameworks as much, we still did add a few elements like (carousel and scroll trigger). <br/>
Project Overseas is how we envision a tour and travel site to made and is thus a part of our professional carrier and our creativity.<br/>
